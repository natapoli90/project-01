## Technologies Used

PLANING TOOLS

* **Minimum Viable Product Scope**
* **Wireframes** for _every_ page
* **User Stories** (divided into sprints) - [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking
* **Database Models and ERD** Make plans for each resource.  List the attributes you'll include in your schemas and what type of data each attribute will be. Draw an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=database%20table%20relationships%20drawing) to illustrate the relationship(s) between models, and note whether you plan to reference or embed related data.

* **jQuery** Use jQuery to add interactivity and render data on the client-side.  
* **Templating** Render the JSON data on the frontend using handlebars templates.  
* **MongoDB** Persist at least two models to a Mongo Database.
* **Visual Design** Use Twitter Bootstrap.
